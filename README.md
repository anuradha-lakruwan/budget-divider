# Expense Tracker

This is an application that allows you to keep track of shared expenses to easily split bills with friends and family.

It is mostly an experiment for my personal use and also to discover new tools/frameworks. Frontend is built thanks to the awesome [Quasar framework](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar) and backend is powered by Go backed with a PostgreSQL database.

## How to use

### Start locally

You must have Docker and Docker Compose installed.if not you can follow the guideline here:https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

Clone the repository and execute :

```bash
make start
```

The project will be available at : http://localhost:8080

If you dont have access to a vm to host the project.you can also use github codespaces.it will allow you to run the project in the cloud and let others to access it.
To allo access to others,please select port forwarding as public in the github codespace runtime and then share the link relevent to port 8080
Then others can access as well! 

You can run this locally or host this on a vm if you have access to one!
